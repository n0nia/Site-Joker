						Mark Hamill’s turn as Joker in the Arkham series is undoubtedly the best portrayal of the character in video games to date. In the original, Arkham Asylum, Joker takes over Arkham Island, exposing his henchmen with the Titan formula in an attempt to create a super army. Joker returns in the sequel, Arkham City, where it is revealed that he is slowly dying from the Titan overdose he took in the previous game.

						Telltale Games, known for its decision-based story adventures, created an original story in Batman: The Telltale Series in which Batman eventually teamed up with a mysterious individual who called himself simply “John Doe.” In the second season, Batman: The Enemy Within, John Doe is revealed to be the Joker, who, after being discharged from Arkham Asylum joins a team of villains that include Bane, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn, who was John’s psychiatrist.

						The Injustice games may appear to be your standard fighting games on the surface, but scratch deeper and they weave some wild stories. In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Joker plays a central role by tricking Superman into killing his pregnant wife Lois Lane, eventually driving him insane and turning him evil.

						The Clown Prince of Crime has appeared in every iteration of the LEGO Batman series of games, beginning with the first in 2008. As something of a rarity in Batman games, Joker is actually a playable character in the LEGO series, complete with signature abilities and costumes. After breaking out of Arkham Asylum in the first game, he teams up with Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, and other dastardly villains to spread Joker Gas around Gotham City.
